# MERN E-commerce Web App

See development branch

This is an ongoing project that aims to build a full-stack e-commerce web application with login, registration, and reset password functionality. The app will allow users to browse and purchase products, manage their user account information, including shipping and billing addresses and payment methods. The app will also include product filtering and sorting, product reviews and ratings, shopping cart and checkout functionality, customer support, and order tracking.

## Technologies Used

- Express: a popular Node.js web framework used for building server-side applications and APIs.
- MongoDB: a popular NoSQL database used for storing data in a document-oriented format.
- Mongoose: an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- Body-parser: a middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.
- Cors: a package that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Node.js for web applications.
- Dotenv: a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
- Nodemon: a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
- React: a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React-router-dom: a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.
- Axios: a promise-based HTTP client for making requests to APIs and fetching data.
- Redux: a predictable state container for JavaScript applications.
- React-redux: a library that provides bindings between React and Redux.
- Redux-thunk: a middleware for Redux that allows you to write async logic that interacts with the store.
- React-bootstrap: a popular front-end framework for building responsive, mobile-first web applications using Bootstrap.
- Bcrypt: a password-hashing function designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making it harder for attackers to brute-force passwords.
- Jsonwebtoken: a library for encoding and decoding JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) in JavaScript. JWTs are a compact, self-contained mechanism for securely transmitting information between parties, typically used for authentication and authorization purposes. The library provides a simple interface for generating and verifying JWTs, as well as for setting and checking expiration times and other claims.
Cookie-parser: a middleware that parses cookies attached to the client request object. It populates req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names.

- Analytics and reporting to track and analyze user behavior and sales data.

## Testing

To test the API endpoints, the project will utilize POSTMAN, a popular API testing tool that allows developers to send HTTP requests and receive responses from APIs. This will enable the project team to verify that the APIs are working as expected and debug any issues that arise.
